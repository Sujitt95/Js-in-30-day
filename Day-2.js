// Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
// Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
// Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
// Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
// Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
// Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

console.log(`subtraction is ${num1-num2}`);
console.log(`multipcation is ${num1*num2}`);
console.log(`division is ${num1/num2}`);
console.log(`the remender is ${num1%num2}`);



// Activity 2: Assignment Operators
// Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let x= 55;
x+=5 //so now x is 60;
console.log(x);

// Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
x-=10
console.log(x);

// Activity 3: Comparison Operators
// Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
let age = 23;
console.log(`age is greater than 18 : ${age>18}`);
console.log(`age is smaller than 18 :${age<18}`);

// Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
console.log(5>=5);
console.log(8<=10);

// Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
console.log(5=="5");//true
console.log(5==="5");//false

// Activity 4: Logical Operators
// Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
console.log(true && false);

// Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
console.log(true || false);

// Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
let i=0;
console.log(i!=1);

// Activity 5: Ternary Operator
// Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
let k = -44;
console.log(k>0?"its positive":"negative");
